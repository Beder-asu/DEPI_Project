# Employee Attrition Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview and Use Cases

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition patterns using machine learning techniques to help organizations understand and predict employee turnover. The analysis provides valuable insights into factors that contribute to employee attrition, enabling HR departments and management teams to make data-driven decisions.

### Key Use Cases:
- **HR Analytics**: Identify key factors contributing to employee turnover
- **Predictive Modeling**: Predict which employees are likely to leave the organization
- **Strategic Planning**: Enable proactive retention strategies based on data insights
- **Cost Reduction**: Reduce recruitment and training costs by improving employee retention
- **Organizational Health**: Monitor and improve workplace satisfaction and engagement

## Tech Stack

### Data Analysis & Machine Learning:
- **Python 3.x** - Primary programming language
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning algorithms and tools
- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization
- **Seaborn** - Statistical data visualization
- **Plotly Express** - Interactive visualizations
- **Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)** - Handling imbalanced datasets

### Development Environment:

- **Git** - Version control

### Web Interface:
- **Vercel** - Deployment platform for web interface
- Custom GUI for model interaction

## Dataset

The project uses the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance** dataset (WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv), which contains comprehensive employee information including:

### Key Features:
- **Demographic Information**: Age, Gender, Marital Status
- **Job-Related Factors**: Job Role, Department, Job Level, Job Satisfaction
- **Compensation**: Monthly Income, Stock Option Level, Percent Salary Hike
- **Work Experience**: Total Working Years, Years at Company, Years in Current Role
- **Work-Life Balance**: Distance from Home, Work-Life Balance Rating
- **Performance Metrics**: Performance Rating, Training Times Last Year
- **Target Variable**: Attrition (Yes/No)

### Data Characteristics:
- No missing values in the dataset
- Removed constant value columns (EmployeeCount, Over18, StandardHours)
- Binary target variable converted to numerical format (Yes=1, No=0)

## Progress So Far

### âœ… Completed:
- **Data Exploration & Profiling**: Comprehensive analysis of dataset characteristics
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Handled categorical variables with encoding
  - Applied SMOTE for addressing class imbalance
  - Feature selection using SelectKBest
  - Data standardization with StandardScaler
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Pair plots for numerical features
  - Statistical insights and patterns identification
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Implemented multiple algorithms (RandomForest, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
  - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
  - Model evaluation with comprehensive metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC)
- **Model Selection**: RandomForest identified as the best performing model
- **Visualization**: ROC curves and performance metrics visualization
- **Web Interface**: Deployed GUI for model interaction

### ðŸ”„ In Progress:
- Model optimization and fine-tuning
- Advanced feature engineering
- Cross-validation improvements
